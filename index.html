            <h3>My Bio</h3>
            <p>I started with programming with more or less 10 years old with an old <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clipper_(programming_language)">clipper</a> book ( <em>9.0 I think</em> ). A couple years later I started studying C/C++ with some graphics and sound librarie  with the major interest of creating games. I also created some <strong><abbr title="Hypertext Markup Language">HTML</abbr></strong> static web pages for fun. I was always playing around with programming languages until I went to university and stop. Some years later I had a chance to make some websites as a freelancer with “Joomla!” and started again to do my self-learning on the programming world.</p>
            <p>For the last years I’d only get back to programming as a hobby. I was doing some little unfinished project for a couple months, stop, then getting after a year more or less. I always liked to program games, it was very easy and fun to see the results.</p>
            <p>I tried a lot of pieces of techs like C,C++, Java, Python, Delphi, a lot of game engines but I don’t remember how I dived into the web development. It was something very new, I still thought that web pages was made like static pages or CMS, that’s it.</p>
            <p>After a lot of researches I start to feel the same fun and joy to learn, try and see the results with web development. I’m still just a enthusiast, I can’t do anything without some googling yet. I barely know CSS, JS, PHP, ReactJS...  but every step I did was very fun.</p>
